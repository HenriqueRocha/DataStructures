# DataStructures

`IntCollection` is an interface with a few operations that are common to both the linked list and the binary tree implementations just like the `Collection` interface in the standard Java library.

`IntLinkedList` is a basic linked list implementation for integers and `IntLinkedListTest` contains all the unit tests that were used to test-drive the implementation.

`IntBinTree` is an implementation of a binary tree and `IntBST` extends `IntBinTree` providing an implementation of a binary search tree.
